    "The psychopathology factor (P-factor) is a widely recognized construct in mental health research, representing a common underlying dimension of psychopathology across various disorders.\n",
    "Currently, the P-factor is often assessed using self-report questionnaires or clinician ratings, which can be subjective, prone to bias, and time-consuming.\n",
    "**The Challenge 2** consists of developing a model to predict the P-factor from EEG recordings.\n",

    "Unlike a standard in-distribution classification task, this regression problem stresses out-of-distribution robustness\n",
